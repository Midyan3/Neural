# Neural Network library in C++

Welcome to my very first neural network project! This C++ implementation showcases the power and flexibility of neural networks and serves as an educational tool for those looking to get into the world of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML).

## Background

I've always wanted to build my very own neural network from scratch but I never had the chance till now. This project was fun, rewarding, and frustrating but it was all worth it in the end. I'm still a novice at Machine Learning and wish to continue learning more. Feel free to use the code as well as point any issues out as I would love to learn more from it. Thank you and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did making it :)


## Features
- Customizable Neural Network Architecture: Define the number of input, hidden, and output neurons.
- Activation Functions: Implementations of Sigmoid and ReLU functions for neural activation.
- Training & Testing: Methods to train the neural network using backpropagation and test its accuracy on your data.
- Regularization Techniques: L1 and L2 regularization options to prevent overfitting.
- Learning Rate Adjustment: Ability to fine-tune the rate at which your network learns.
## Installation

**Prerequisites:**
- A modern C++ compiler
- Basic knowledge of C++ and neural network concepts

**Steps:**
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile the source files using your preferred C++ compiler or development environment (e.g., Visual Studio, g++, etc.).
4. After successful compilation, you can run the program.

### (I've also included a main.cpp with a starter code that works to train the neural network on detecting input {1} and output {1} as well as input {0} and output {0})
